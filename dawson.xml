<p>On Saturday, September 12, the Kenn Borek Aquatic Centre will begin their phased re-opening with a limited public swim schedule and enhanced safety protocols. <strong>To ensure the number of people in the building is below 50 (per the Provincial Health Order), customers must register in advance for public swim:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Register online at www.dawsoncreek.ca/register.</li>
	<li>Register by phone at 250-782-7946.</li>
	<li>Register in person at City Hall, Community Services Office (M-F, 8:30am-4:30pm).</li>
</ol>
<p>At this time, there are no swim or fitness classes being offered. </p>
<p>Aquatic staff have prepared the facility to operate during the unique circumstances of a pandemic. We are opening in a slow and progressive manner, in line with guidelines from the Province of BC, Provincial Health Officer, Worksafe BC, Northern Health, BCRPA and the Lifesaving Society of BC. </p>
<p>It is important that everyone is aware of their current health before coming; if you are sick, don't come swimming.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The Kenn Borek Aquatic Centre will be re-opening on September 12 and we are excited to welcome everyone back!</p>
<p>We are opening with a limited 5-day swim schedule (Phase One) which will last for approximately 4-6 weeks at which time we will re-evaluate. Depending on the changing situation of the COVID-19 Pandemic, our goal is to move to a 7 day per week schedule. </p>
<p>Due to the protocols required and health measures in place, public swim will be limited to 40 people only. Public swim will by registration only and set up in 80 minute blocks of time; everyone wishing to attend MUST be registered for it (including babies) as it counts towards our capacity of 40 people. </p>
<p>We will also be introducing a new pilot program - a Sensory Friendly Swim - which will be open to everyone who may have sensory issues or just want a quiet swim time. </p>
