		<description><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to welcome everyone back!</p>
<p>On Saturday, September 12, the Kenn Borek Aquatic Centre will begin their phased re-opening with a limited public swim schedule and enhanced safety protocols. <strong>To ensure the number of people in the building is below 50 (per the Provincial Health Order), customers must register in advance for public swim:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Register online at www.dawsoncreek.ca/register.</li>
	<li>Register by phone at 250-782-7946.</li>
	<li>Register in person at City Hall, Community Services Office (M-F, 8:30am-4:30pm).</li>
</ol>
<p>At this time, there are no swim or fitness classes being offered. </p>
<p>Aquatic staff have prepared the facility to operate during the unique circumstances of a pandemic. We are opening in a slow and progressive manner, in line with guidelines from the Province of BC, Provincial Health Officer, Worksafe BC, Northern Health, BCRPA and the Lifesaving Society of BC. </p>
<p>It is important that everyone is aware of their current health before coming; if you are sick, don't come swimming. Learn what you need to know (safety protocol, schedules, registration) before arriving, by clicking <a href="https://www.dawsoncreek.ca/departments/communityservices/pool/schedules/?preview_id=20975&amp;preview_nonce=530a904a20&amp;_thumbnail_id=-1&amp;preview=true#gsc.tab=0">here</a> and watching the video below. </p>
